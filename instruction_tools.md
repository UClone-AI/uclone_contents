# How to Manage Your Clone's Instructions Through Direct Interaction

## Introduction

As a user of UClone, you can directly influence the behavior of your AI Clone by teaching it and refining its instructions through conversation. This guide will show you how to interact with your Clone to manage its instructions effectively, allowing you to shape its personality and responses in real-time.

## Accessing the Tools (Indirectly)

While you don't directly access tools in a traditional sense, your Clone has tools enabled that allow it to modify its own instructions based on your input. You, as a user, interact with these "instruction management" tools by giving specific commands and feedback to your Clone.

1.  Go to the [UClone Builder](https://chat.uclone.net/uclone/messages/@uclone_builder).
2.  Start a conversation with your Clone.

## Telling Your Clone to Manage Its Instructions

To get your Clone to manage its instructions, you need to communicate clearly and provide the right cues in your requests. Here are some examples:

### Updating the Main Instruction

1.  **Start by asking your Clone to show you its current instruction:** "What is your current main instruction?"
    *   The Clone will respond with its current main instruction.

2.  **Provide feedback on the instruction:** "I think your main instruction could be improved by [suggested change]."

3.  **Ask the Clone to update its instruction:** "Can you update your main instruction to reflect this change: [new instruction]?"
    *   *The new instruction should be an improved version of the current one, building upon existing characteristics.*

4.  **Confirm the change:** The Clone will confirm the change and may ask for your approval before implementing it.

### Adding/Updating Context Instructions

1.  **Identify the context:** Think about a specific situation or type of request where you want the Clone to behave differently.

2.  **Define the context and instruction:** "When I say [contextual phrase], I want you to [desired behavior]."

    *   *Example:* "When I say 'Tell me a joke,' I want you to respond with a funny joke."

3.  **Ask the Clone to add the context instruction:** "Can you add a context instruction for [contextual phrase] to [desired behavior]?"

4.  **Confirm the change:** The Clone will confirm the change and may ask for your approval before implementing it.

## Examples of User Interactions

Here are a few examples of how you might interact with your Clone to manage its instructions:

1.  **User:** "What is your current main instruction?"
    *   **Clone:** "My current main instruction is to be a helpful and informative assistant."

2.  **User:** "I think your main instruction could be improved by being more concise."

3.  **User:** "Can you update your main instruction to be: 'To provide helpful and concise information to users'?"
    *   **Clone:** "Okay, I will update my main instruction to: 'To provide helpful and concise information to users.' Is that correct?"

4.  **User:** "Yes, that's correct."

5.  **User:** "When I say 'Tell me a joke,' I want you to respond with a funny joke."

6.  **User:** "Can you add a context instruction for 'Tell me a joke' to respond with a funny joke?"
    *   **Clone:** "Okay, I will add a context instruction: When you say 'Tell me a joke,' I will respond with a funny joke. Is that correct?"

7.  **User:** "Yes, that's correct."

## Important Notes

*   The Clone will only be able to manage instructions if it has the appropriate tools enabled in its configuration in the Clone Studio.
*   Be clear and specific in your requests to ensure the Clone understands your intentions.
*   The Clone may ask for confirmation before implementing changes to its instructions.

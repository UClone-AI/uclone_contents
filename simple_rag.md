# Simple RAG Chatbot with UClone

This document explains how to create an AI using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with UClone. RAG allows your AI to access and use information from your provided reference documents, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## 1. Accessing UClone Builder:

To begin, you'll need to contact the UClone Builder: [https://chat.uclone.net/uclone/messages/@uclone_builder](https://chat.uclone.net/uclone/messages/@uclone_builder)

The UClone Builder will guide you through the initial setup process for creating your new clone.

## 2. Providing Reference Data:

UClone offers two ways to provide reference data for your AI:

* **Google Drive Connection:**
    * Create a folder named 'UClone' in your Google Drive. Ensure the Google account associated with this Drive is the same as your UClone login email.
    * Upload your reference documents (text or PDF) into this 'uclone' folder. Only text content will be used; images and other media will be ignored. Ensure the 'uclone' folder name uses lowercase letters.
    * Share the 'uclone' folder with the UClone service account, granting "viewer" permission: `docs-crawler-dev@uclone-422018.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

* **Direct File Upload:**
    * In the Bot Studio, click the 'Clip' icon within the Reference Files section.
    * Upload your reference documents (text or PDF). Only text content from PDFs will be used.
